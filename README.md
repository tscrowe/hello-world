For University of Arizona GIST604B class assignment

## About Me
1. I am a Master of Science student at the University of Arizona studying Geographic Information Science Technology (GIST).  My bachelor degree is a BA International Relations and Interstate Diplomacy from the University of Minnesota.  I earned that degree in 1998...so only a 20-year gap!  That 20 years was spent in the U.S. Army.  I retired from the Army in 2015, however I continue to work as a Department of the Army civilian at Fort Huachuca, Arizona.  
2. The only real programing experience I have beyond python course in the MS-GIST program was as child on a Commodore VIC 20 and the Commodore 64.  However, I find it fascinating and am eager to learn more about coding and using various new applications.
3. My hobbies include being an amateur photographer, my dog Ginger and my 2005 BMW R1200RT motorcycle.
